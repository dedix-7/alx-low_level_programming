# About
This project is about linked lists,
Now I don't completely **understand**(By understand I mean the feynman way of understanding adopted by **Holberton**)
structs and malloc,
But I am doingthis and once I get it, I'll be able to exp[lain it well.

## 0-print_list.c
This file is about making a function that prints all elements of a linked list
## lists.h
The header file containing all function prototypes and included standard libraries
